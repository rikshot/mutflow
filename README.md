## What is this?

mutflow brings mutation testing to Kotlin with minimal overhead. Instead of the traditional approach (compile and run each mutant separately), mutflow:

1. **Compiles once** - All mutation variants are injected at compile time as conditional branches
2. **Discovers dynamically** - Mutation points are found during baseline test execution
3. **Runs all mutations** - Every discovered mutation is tested by default, no configuration needed

## Why?

Traditional mutation testing is powerful but expensive. Most teams skip it entirely.

mutflow trades exhaustiveness for practicality: low setup cost, no separate tooling, runs in your normal test suite. Some mutation testing is better than none.

## What mutflow tests (and what it doesn't)

mutflow closes the gap between code coverage and assertion quality. Coverage tells you code was executed; mutflow verifies your assertions actually catch behavioral changes.

**Important:** mutflow only tests code reached within `MutFlow.underTest { }` blocks. Unreached code produces no mutations - mutflow won't warn you. This is intentional (keeps scope focused) but means you should use coverage tools separately to ensure code is exercised at all.

A carefully [selected set of mutation operators](#mutation-operators) is built in, with an extensible architecture for adding new ones. See [features](#features) for the full list of capabilities.

## Setup

Add the mutflow Gradle plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.4.20"
    id("io.github.anschnapp.mutflow") version "<latest-version>"
}
```

### Kotlin Version Compatibility

mutflow tracks the newest Kotlin release and updates frequently. Because compiler
plugins are tightly coupled to the compiler's internal APIs, each mutflow release
requires the Kotlin version it was built against - it will not work with older
Kotlin versions in your project. If you are on an older Kotlin, use the matching
older mutflow release:

| mutflow | Kotlin |
|---------|--------|
| 1.0.2+ | 2.4.x |
| up to 1.0.1 | 2.2.x - 2.3.x |

A mismatch typically fails with an obscure compiler error (e.g. `NoClassDefFoundError`
during compilation) - if you see that, check your Kotlin version first.

Once available, the plugin automatically:
- Adds `mutflow-core` to your implementation dependencies (for `@MutationTarget` annotation)
- Adds `mutflow-junit6` to your test dependencies (for `@MutFlowTest` annotation)
- Configures the compiler plugin for mutation injection

**Important:** The plugin uses a dual-compilation approach - your production JAR remains clean (no mutation code), while tests run against mutated code.

### Specifying Mutation Targets

There are two ways to tell mutflow which classes to mutate - use either or both:

**Option 1: `@MutationTarget` annotation** (on production code)
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator { ... }
```

**Option 2: Gradle configuration** (no annotations on production code)
```kotlin
mutflow {
    targets = listOf(
        "com.example.Calculator",       // exact class
        "com.example.service.*",        // all classes in a package
        "com.example.service.**",       // package + all subpackages
        "com.example.*Service"          // glob pattern
    )
}
```

Both can be combined freely. If a class matches either mechanism, it will be mutated. The Gradle config is useful when you prefer not to annotate production code with test-related annotations.

### Disabling Mutation Testing

You can completely disable mutation testing without removing the plugin. When disabled, no compiler plugin is registered and no extra compilation happens - zero overhead.

```kotlin
// In build.gradle.kts
mutflow {
    enabled = false
}
```

Or via command line:
```bash
./gradlew test -Pmutflow.enabled=false
```

Or in `gradle.properties`:
```properties
mutflow.enabled=false
```

When disabled, your code still compiles normally (`@MutationTarget` and `@MutFlowTest` annotations are still available), but tests run without any mutations - the mutation summary will show 0 mutations discovered.

## Quick Start

```kotlin
// Mark code under test (Option 1: annotation)
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0
}

// Or use Gradle config instead (Option 2: no annotation needed)
// mutflow { targets = listOf("com.example.Calculator") }

// Test with mutation testing - simple!
@MutFlowTest
class CalculatorTest {
    private val calculator = Calculator()

    @Test
    fun `isPositive returns true for positive numbers`() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest {
            calculator.isPositive(5)
        }
        assertTrue(result)
    }

    @Test
    fun `isPositive returns false for negative numbers`() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest {
            calculator.isPositive(-5)
        }
        assertFalse(result)
    }
}
```

That's it! For a more detailed walkthrough, check out this [blog post on dev.to](https://dev.to/5n4p_/i-built-a-single-compile-mutation-testing-lib-for-kotlin-which-runs-inside-your-normal-test-suite-4253).

The `@MutFlowTest` annotation handles everything:
- **Run without mutations**: Discovers mutation points, all tests pass normally
- **Mutation runs**: Each mutation is activated across all tests; if any test catches it (assertion fails), the mutation is killed and tests appear green
- **Survivor detection**: If no test catches a mutation, `MutantSurvivedException` is thrown and the build fails

### Example Output

```
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns true for positive numbers() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns true at boundary() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns false for negative numbers() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns false for zero() PASSED

CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) > → >= > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) > → < > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) 0 → 1 > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) 0 → -1 > ... PASSED

```

**How to read this output:**
- **All tests PASSED** - This is the expected result! During mutation runs, when a test's assertion fails (catching the mutation), the exception is swallowed and the test appears green.
- **Summary shows killed/survived** - After all runs complete, the summary shows which mutations were killed (good) vs survived (gap in coverage).
- **Build fails with `MutantSurvivedException`** - Only if a mutation survives (no test caught it). This indicates missing test coverage.

## Configuration

By default, `@MutFlowTest` runs all discovered mutations - no configuration needed. For large codebases where running all mutations is too slow, you can limit the number of runs:

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(maxRuns = 20)  // Baseline + up to 19 mutation runs
class CalculatorTest { ... }
```

### Target Filtering (Integration Tests)

When an integration test exercises multiple `@MutationTarget` classes but you only want to test mutations in specific ones:

```kotlin
// Only test mutations from Calculator - ignore other @MutationTarget classes reached by underTest
@MutFlowTest(includeTargets = [Calculator::class])
class CalculatorIntegrationTest { ... }

// Test everything except infrastructure classes
@MutFlowTest(excludeTargets = [AuditLogger::class, MetricsService::class])
class PaymentServiceTest { ... }
```

- `includeTargets`: Whitelist - only these classes produce active mutations
- `excludeTargets`: Blacklist - these classes are skipped
- Both can be combined: include narrows first, exclude removes from that set
- Empty (default) = no filtering, all discovered mutations are candidates

All mutation points are still discovered during baseline (for accurate touch counts), but only filtered mutations are selected, counted in the summary, and considered for exhaustion.

### Timeout Detection

Mutations that flip loop conditions (e.g., `<` to `>`) can cause infinite loops. mutflow automatically detects this by injecting a timeout check at the top of every loop body in `@MutationTarget` classes.

- **Default timeout**: 60 seconds per mutation run
- **On timeout**: The test **fails** with a `MutationTimedOutException` suggesting to add `// mutflow:ignore` on the affected line
- **Timed-out mutations** appear in the summary with a `⏱` marker

```kotlin
// Custom timeout (or 0 to disable)
@MutFlowTest(timeoutMs = 30_000)
class CalculatorTest { ... }
```

The timeout check is nearly free: a single `System.nanoTime()` comparison per loop iteration during mutation runs, and an instant null-check return during baseline or production execution.

### Test Budget (Hangs Outside Loops)

The loop check only sees loops inside mutated code. A mutation can also make the code under test wait forever without looping - a flow that never emits, a latch that is never released, a future that never completes - and park the test thread. For that, every test gets a **wall-clock budget** during mutation runs, derived from the test's own baseline duration:

```
budget = baseline duration × testBudgetFactor + testBudgetSlackMs     (default: 3× + 1 s)
```

- A test that exceeds its budget is **interrupted** and fails with `MutationTimedOutException`, like a loop timeout; the mutation shows as `⏱` in the summary.
- The budget is relative on purpose: a fixed limit is too tight for slow suites or too loose to be useful, while three times what the same test took a moment ago in the same JVM is both.
- If the interrupted test still has not returned after `testBudgetGraceMs` (default 10 s), the run is **abandoned**: the test JVM exits with a diagnostic naming the test and the mutation. A thread that ignores interruption cannot be stopped, and it holds the lock every later mutation run needs, so the alternative is a build that hangs until CI kills it.
- During the baseline run, where no reference exists yet, `baselineTimeoutMs` (default 60 s) applies instead.

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(testBudgetFactor = 5, testBudgetSlackMs = 2_000)  // roomier budget
@MutFlowTest(testBudgetFactor = 0)                             // budget off, loop check only
```

The `MUTFLOW_TEST_BUDGET_FACTOR`, `MUTFLOW_TEST_BUDGET_SLACK_MS`, `MUTFLOW_BASELINE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `MUTFLOW_TEST_BUDGET_GRACE_MS` environment variables override the annotation values. The budget covers the test method itself (not `@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach`), on the JVM only: a hung Kotlin/Native run is a hung process, which the Gradle orchestrator's process timeout already kills.

### Traps (Pinning Mutations)

When a mutation survives, you can **trap** it to run it first every time while you fix the test gap:

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(
    traps = ["(Calculator.kt:8) > → >="]  // Copy from survivor output
)
class CalculatorTest { ... }
```

**How traps work:**
1. Mutation survives → build fails with display name like `(Calculator.kt:8) > → >=`
2. Copy the display name into `traps` array
3. Trapped mutation now runs first every time (before random selection)
4. Fix your test until it catches the mutation
5. Remove the trap

Traps run in the order provided, regardless of selection strategy. After all traps are exhausted, normal selection continues.

**Invalid trap handling:** If a trap doesn't match any discovered mutation (e.g., code moved), a warning is printed with available mutations:
```
[mutflow] WARNING: Trap not found: (Calculator.kt:999) > → >=
[mutflow]   Available mutations:
[mutflow]     (Calculator.kt:8) 0 → -1
[mutflow]     (Calculator.kt:8) > → >=
```

### Verification Mode

By default, mutflow uses **strict** verification: surviving mutations fail the build. You can change this behavior per test class or globally.

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(verificationMode = VerificationMode.STRICT)   // default — survivors fail the build
@MutFlowTest(verificationMode = VerificationMode.LENIENT)  // survivors are reported but don't fail
@MutFlowTest(verificationMode = VerificationMode.DISABLED) // mutation runs are skipped entirely
```

**When to use each mode:**
- `STRICT` — Default. Use for CI pipelines where mutation coverage must be maintained.
- `LENIENT` — Use when building up test coverage incrementally. Mutations still run and are reported in the summary, but survivors don't break the build. This lets you focus on writing regular tests first and address surviving mutations later.
- `DISABLED` — Use when you only want fast feedback from regular tests. Only the baseline runs — no mutations are tested at all.

**Environment variable override:**

The `MUTFLOW_VERIFICATION_MODE` environment variable overrides the annotation value for all test classes. This enables phased CI pipelines:

```bash
# Phase 1: Fast feedback — only regular tests
MUTFLOW_VERIFICATION_MODE=DISABLED ./gradlew test

# Phase 2: Full mutation testing
./gradlew test
```

Or for a gradual adoption workflow:

```bash
# Run mutation tests but don't block the build yet
MUTFLOW_VERIFICATION_MODE=LENIENT ./gradlew test
```

The environment variable accepts `STRICT`, `LENIENT`, or `DISABLED` (case-insensitive). Invalid values produce a warning and fall back to the annotation value.

### Suppressing Mutations

Suppression works regardless of how the class was targeted (annotation or Gradle config). mutflow provides three levels of suppression granularity:

**Class level** - skip all mutations in a class:
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
@SuppressMutations
class LegacyCalculator { ... }
```

**Function level** - skip mutations in a specific function:
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    @SuppressMutations
    fun debugLog(x: Int): Boolean = x > 100
}
```

**Line level** - skip mutations on a single line using comments:
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    fun process(x: Int): Boolean {
        val threshold = x > 100 // mutflow:ignore this is just a heuristic
        // mutflow:falsePositive equivalent mutant, boundary doesn't matter
        val inRange = x >= 0
        return threshold && inRange
    }
}
```

Two comment keywords are supported - same technical effect, different intent:
- `mutflow:ignore` - the code is not worth testing (logging, debug utilities, heuristics)
- `mutflow:falsePositive` - the mutation is an equivalent mutant or not meaningful to test

Free-form text after the keyword documents the reason for reviewers.

**Inline comment** suppresses mutations on the same line. **Standalone comment** (on its own line) suppresses mutations on the next line. Comments have zero production overhead - they are stripped by the compiler and nothing appears in the production bytecode.

### Selection and Shuffle Parameters

`MutFlow.underTest { }` accepts optional parameters for controlling mutation selection and ordering:

```kotlin
// Baseline
MutFlow.underTest(run = 0, Selection.MostLikelyStable, Shuffle.PerChange) {
    calculator.isPositive(5)
}

// Mutation runs
MutFlow.underTest(run = 1, Selection.MostLikelyStable, Shuffle.PerChange) {
    calculator.isPositive(5)
}
```

Selection strategies (`PureRandom`, `MostLikelyRandom`, `MostLikelyStable`) and shuffle modes (`PerRun`, `PerChange`) control how mutations are prioritized. The `@MutFlowTest` annotation uses sensible defaults automatically - these parameters are only needed for custom integrations.

## Verifying Production Artifacts

The Gradle plugin compiles mutations into a separate `mutatedMain` source set, so your production JAR never contains them. If you want a hard guarantee in your release pipeline (for example right before `docker build`), use the shipped check script:

```bash
scripts/mutflow-verify-jar.sh build/libs/my-app.jar
```

It scans every class in the archive, including nested archives such as Spring Boot's `BOOT-INF/lib/*.jar` and shadow JARs, and fails if a class references the mutflow runtime registry (`MutationRegistry`), which is what an injected mutation switch looks like in bytecode.

What is fine in a production artifact:

- the `mutflow-annotations` classes (`@MutationTarget`, `@SuppressMutations`) - `BINARY` retention markers with no runtime behavior
- your own classes annotated with `@MutationTarget`

What fails the check:

- any class carrying injected mutation switches
- bundled mutflow core/runtime classes (pass `--allow-bundled-runtime` to permit them)

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings, `2` usage error or missing `unzip`.

Typical CI usage:

```bash
./gradlew build
scripts/mutflow-verify-jar.sh build/libs/*.jar || exit 1
docker build -t my-app .
```

Example failure output:

```
MUTATION  build/libs/my-app.jar!/BOOT-INF/classes/com/example/PricingService.class
FAILED: found 1 class(es) containing mutflow mutations.
The artifact was built with the mutflow compiler plugin applied to production code.
```

The script requires `bash` and `unzip`. It is tested end-to-end by `scripts/test-mutflow-verify-jar.sh`, which runs on every pull request: it publishes mutflow to mavenLocal, builds a small consumer project with the real Gradle plugin, and asserts that the production JAR passes while the `mutatedMain` compilation of the very same sources is rejected.

## Mutation Operators

- [**Relational comparisons**](#how-relational-comparison-mutations-work) - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` with 2 variants each (boundary + flip)
- [**Constant boundary**](#how-constant-boundary-mutations-work) - Numeric constants in comparisons mutated by +1/-1 (e.g., `0 → 1`, `0 → -1`)
- [**Arithmetic**](#how-arithmetic-mutations-work) - `+` ↔ `-`, `*` ↔ `/`, `%` → `/` (with safe division to avoid div-by-zero)
- [**Equality swaps**](#how-equality-swap-mutations-work) - `==` ↔ `!=` (1 variant each)
- [**Boolean logic swaps**](#how-boolean-logic-mutations-work) - `&&` ↔ `||` (1 variant each)
- [**Boolean inversion**](#how-boolean-inversion-mutations-work) - `expr` → `!expr` for boolean function calls, property accesses, and variables/parameters (1 variant each)
- [**Boolean return**](#how-boolean-return-mutations-work) - Boolean return values replaced with `true`/`false` (explicit returns only)
- [**Nullable return**](#how-nullable-return-mutations-work) - Nullable return values replaced with `null` (explicit returns only)
- [**Void function body**](#how-void-function-body-mutations-work) - Unit function bodies replaced with empty bodies, detecting untested side effects
- [**Exception type swap**](#how-exception-type-swap-mutations-work) - Thrown exceptions replaced with a sibling type (e.g. `IllegalArgumentException` → `IllegalStateException`), detecting tests that assert *something* threw but not *what*
- **Recursive operator nesting** - Multiple mutation types combine on the same expression
- **Type-agnostic** - Works with `Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Float`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Char`

## Features

**Core**
- **JUnit 6 integration** - `@MutFlowTest` annotation for automatic multi-run orchestration
- **K2 compiler plugin** - Transforms `@MutationTarget` classes (or Gradle-configured target patterns) with multiple mutation types
- **Parameterless API** - Simple `MutFlow.underTest { }` when using JUnit extension
- **Runs all mutations by default** - Zero-config: `@MutFlowTest` tests every discovered mutation

**Reporting**
- **Summary reporting** - Visual summary at end of test class showing killed/survived mutations
- **Readable mutation names** - Source location and operator descriptions (e.g., `(Calculator.kt:7) > → >=`, `(Calculator.kt:7) 0 → 1`). When the same operator appears multiple times on one line, an occurrence suffix disambiguates (e.g., `> → >= #2`)
- **IDE-clickable links** - Source locations in IntelliJ-compatible format for quick navigation
- **Mutation result tracking** - Killed mutations show as PASSED (exception swallowed), survivors fail the build

**Control**
- **Verification mode** - `STRICT` (default, survivors fail), `LENIENT` (survivors reported only), `DISABLED` (skip mutations). Configurable per annotation or globally via `MUTFLOW_VERIFICATION_MODE` env var
- **`@SuppressMutations`** - Skip mutations on specific classes or functions
- **Comment-based line suppression** - `// mutflow:ignore` and `// mutflow:falsePositive` to skip individual lines (zero production overhead)
- **Target filtering** - `includeTargets`/`excludeTargets` to scope mutations by class in integration tests
- **Trap mechanism** - Pin specific mutations to run first while debugging test gaps

**Robustness**
- **Timeout detection** - Mutations that cause infinite loops (e.g., flipping `<` in a loop condition) are automatically detected and reported. Compiler-injected `checkTimeout()` at the top of every loop body ensures even tight loops are caught. Test fails with actionable guidance to add `// mutflow:ignore`
- **Test budget** - Mutations that make the code under test wait forever outside any loop (a flow that never emits, a latch never released) are caught by a per-test wall-clock budget derived from the test's own baseline duration; the test is interrupted and reported as timed out
- **Partial run detection** - Automatically skips mutation testing when running single tests from IDE (prevents false positives)
- **Parallel test safe** - Mutation test classes can run alongside other tests in parallel; `underTest {}` blocks serialize automatically via a synchronized lock, without using `ThreadLocal` (keeping the door open for coroutine/reactive support)
- **Session-based architecture** - Clean lifecycle, no leaked global state

**Extensibility**
- **Extensible architecture** - `MutationOperator` (for calls), `ReturnMutationOperator` (for returns), `WhenMutationOperator` (for boolean logic), `FunctionBodyMutationOperator` (for function bodies), and `ThrowMutationOperator` (for throw statements) interfaces for adding new mutation types

## Kotlin Multiplatform Support

mutflow also runs on Kotlin/Native targets in Multiplatform projects. The
published targets are `linuxX64` and `mingwX64`. The Gradle wiring is generic
over native targets rather than written per target, so it is designed to work on
any target where Kotlin/Native tests can run at all, but the published list is
deliberately narrower than that: a target ships once its tests have been run
somewhere, and covering every target Kotlin supports is not a goal here. Within
this project the native path is verified on `linuxX64` (see Current limitations
below, and [Trying an unpublished target](#trying-an-unpublished-target) if you
need one that is not shipped).

To our knowledge it is the first mutation testing tool for Kotlin/Native: traditional
tools mutate JVM bytecode, which does not exist on Native, and recompiling per
mutant is impractical with native compile times. mutflow's compile-once
approach sidesteps both problems.

### Setup

Apply the same plugin in a KMP project:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "2.4.20"
    id("io.github.anschnapp.mutflow") version "<latest-version>"
}

kotlin {
    jvm()
    linuxX64()
    // ... other targets
}
```

Every target gets mutation testing. They differ only in how the runs are
driven: the `jvm()` target uses the ordinary in-process JUnit path, native
targets get one process per mutation from a Gradle task.

Add one line to `gradle.properties` (the instrumented test compilation shares
sources with the main compilation, which KGP warns about; this suppresses only
that specific diagnostic):

```properties
kotlin.suppressGradlePluginWarnings=KotlinSourceSetDependsOnDefaultCompilationSourceSet
```

### Writing tests

Tests are plain kotlin-test in `commonTest` with the same `underTest` API - no
JUnit import, no annotation. The same file is the test suite for every target;
on the `jvm()` target the compiler plugin synthesizes the `@MutFlowTest` that
`commonTest` cannot name in source:

```kotlin
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    fun positiveNumber() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest { calculator.isPositive(5) }
        assertTrue(result)
    }
}
```

### Running

Mutation testing is a dedicated, opt-in task per target (plain `test`/`check`
runs are untouched):

```bash
./gradlew mutflowJvmTest        # the jvm() target, in-process JUnit runs
./gradlew mutflowLinuxX64Test   # one native target
./gradlew mutflowNativeTest     # all native targets runnable on this host
```

`mutflowJvmTest` re-runs each test class once per mutation inside one JVM, so
the IDE test tree shows every run - the same experience a plain
`kotlin("jvm")` project gets. The native task instead runs the test binary
once for discovery and then once per mutation, printing the same summary. A
failing test suite during a mutation run means the mutation was killed;
survivors fail the build either way.

### Configuration

In a multiplatform project the `@MutFlowTest` parameters live in the Gradle
DSL, and apply to every target:

```kotlin
mutflow {
    maxMutationRuns = 20        // default: unlimited (all mutations)
    timeoutMs = 60_000L         // infinite-loop protection deadline
    verificationMode = "STRICT" // STRICT | LENIENT | DISABLED
    testBudgetFactor = 3        // per-test wall-clock budget, × baseline duration (jvm() target; 0 = off)
    testBudgetSlackMs = 1_000L  // fixed allowance on top
    baselineTimeoutMs = 60_000L // absolute limit during the baseline run
    testBudgetGraceMs = 10_000L // interrupted test still running this long: abandon the run
}
```

There is no annotation to configure instead: the one on multiplatform test
classes is generated, so the DSL is the configuration surface. (A plain
`kotlin("jvm")` project keeps configuring `@MutFlowTest` directly.)

`MUTFLOW_VERIFICATION_MODE` overrides the mode per run, like on the JVM.
`@MutationTarget`, Gradle target patterns, `@SuppressMutations` and the
comment-based suppression (`// mutflow:ignore`, `// mutflow:falsePositive`)
work unchanged - they are compile-time and backend-neutral. Timed-out
mutations (infinite loops) fail the build with the affected line, same
fail-loudly rule as the JVM.

### How it works

The compiler plugin is backend-agnostic and runs unchanged. What differs is
orchestration: kotlin-test on Native has no extension mechanism, so the run
loop lives in the Gradle task - one process per mutation, activated via an
environment variable, with the exit code deciding killed vs. survived. The
`jvm()` target keeps the in-process JUnit loop; it only needs the compiler
plugin to write `@MutFlowTest` into the bytecode, because `commonTest` sources
must also compile for Native and cannot name a JVM-only annotation.
Production klibs, jars and binaries stay clean: instrumentation only exists in
a dedicated second test compilation. See
[DESIGN-MULTIPLATFORM.md](DESIGN-MULTIPLATFORM.md) for the full architecture
and [example-native/](example-native/) for a working project.

### Current limitations

- **Targets**: `linuxX64` and `mingwX64` for now. mingwX64 cross-compiles
  from Linux but has not yet been exercised on a Windows host. macOS and
  Apple simulator targets are not published yet - not for any code reason,
  but because we have no Apple machine to run their tests on, and shipping a
  mutation testing tool for a target whose tests we have never executed is a
  promise we are not making yet. If you have a Mac, you can build them
  yourself today - see [Trying an unpublished target](#trying-an-unpublished-target).
- **No traps and no random selection strategies on Native yet**; mutations
  run in the deterministic most-likely-to-survive order (fewest-touched
  first), so `maxMutationRuns` caps runs where they matter most.
- **`maxMutationRuns` selects per target**, so with a cap set the JVM and
  native targets may test different subsets. Unlimited runs (the default)
  are unaffected.
- **No IDE test-tree integration on Native**: results arrive as Gradle output
  plus the summary. Recommended workflow in KMP projects: develop against the
  `jvm()` target for interactive feedback, run native mutation verification in
  CI.
- **The multiplatform configuration surface is young**: `commonTest` sources
  cannot name `@MutFlowTest`, so settings live in the Gradle DSL instead of on
  the annotation. That split may still be revised. The `kotlin("jvm")` path is
  unaffected.

### Trying an unpublished target

The native targets mutflow publishes are the ones it supports, and that is a
rule of Kotlin Multiplatform rather than a policy: a project can only depend on
a KMP library whose target set is a superset of its own. Declaring
`macosArm64()` against a mutflow that does not publish `macosArm64` gives you a
"no matching variant" resolution failure, not a degraded mutflow.

Nothing in mutflow's source is target-specific, though. The native
implementations live in a shared `nativeMain` source set that every native
target inherits, and the Gradle plugin is written generically over targets
rather than per target. So you can build the artifacts for a target we do not
publish, without editing any build file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anschnapp/mutflow && cd mutflow
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Pmutflow.extraNativeTargets=macosArm64
```

Pass a comma-separated list for several (`macosArm64,macosX64`). The name is
the Kotlin target function name. All mutflow modules read the same property, so
their target sets stay consistent automatically.

Then consume it from your own project:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenLocal()   // before mavenCentral()
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Use the same version the clone builds (`0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` by default, or pass
`-PreleaseVersion=<something>`).

What you get depends on the target:

- **A target your machine can run** (`macosArm64` on an Apple Silicon Mac):
  full mutation testing. The plugin registers `mutflowMacosArm64Test` and it
  works exactly like `mutflowLinuxX64Test`.
- **A target your machine can only build** (any simulator or device target, or
  `macosArm64` from Linux - Apple klibs cross-compile fine): the instrumented
  test binary is produced as compile proof, but no mutation task is registered,
  since the orchestrator has to execute the binary to run mutations. This is
  the same status `mingwX64` has on a Linux host.

If you try a target this way and it works, please open an issue - a report from
a machine we do not have is exactly what a target needs to move into the
published set.

## How Mutations Work

### How Relational Comparison Mutations Work

Relational comparison mutations verify that your tests exercise boundary conditions and direction of comparisons.

**Example:** For `fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `> → >=` | `x >= 0` | `isPositive(0)` should be false |
| `> → <` | `x < 0` | `isPositive(1)` should be true |

Each relational operator produces 2 variants - a boundary mutation (include/exclude equality) and a direction flip:

| Original | Boundary variant | Flip variant |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| `>` | `>=` | `<` |
| `>=` | `>` | `<=` |
| `<` | `<=` | `>` |
| `<=` | `<` | `>=` |

If your tests only use values far from the boundary (e.g., `isPositive(5)` and `isPositive(-5)`), the boundary variant may survive - revealing the gap.

### How Constant Boundary Mutations Work

The constant boundary mutation detects poorly tested boundaries that operator mutations alone cannot find.

**Example:** For `fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `> → >=` | `x >= 0` | `isPositive(0)` should be false |
| `> → <` | `x < 0` | `isPositive(1)` should be true |
| `0 → 1` | `x > 1` | `isPositive(1)` should be true |
| `0 → -1` | `x > -1` | `isPositive(0)` should be false |

If your tests only use values far from the boundary (e.g., `isPositive(5)` and `isPositive(-5)`), the constant mutations will survive - revealing the gap in boundary testing.

### How Arithmetic Mutations Work

Arithmetic mutations verify that your tests detect when math operations are swapped.

**Example:** For `fun total(price: Int, tax: Int) = price + tax`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `+ → -` | `price - tax` | `total(100, 10)` should be `110` |

The full set of arithmetic swaps:

| Original | Mutated to |
|----------|------------|
| `+` | `-` |
| `-` | `+` |
| `*` | `/` (with safe division) |
| `/` | `*` |
| `%` | `/` |

**Safe division:** When mutating `*` to `/`, mutflow guards against division by zero. If the divisor is 0, it computes `divisor / dividend` instead; if both are 0, it returns 1. This prevents `ArithmeticException` from masking the actual mutation test.

### How Equality Swap Mutations Work

Equality swap mutations verify that your tests distinguish between `==` and `!=` conditions.

**Example:** For `fun isZero(x: Int) = x == 0`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `== → !=` | `x != 0` | `isZero(0)` should be true |

And for `fun isNotZero(x: Int) = x != 0`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `!= → ==` | `x == 0` | `isNotZero(5)` should be true |

If your tests only exercise values where `==` and `!=` produce different results for obvious inputs, the mutations will be killed. But if tests use ambiguous inputs or don't assert the return value, survivors reveal the gap.

### How Boolean Logic Mutations Work

Boolean logic mutations verify that your tests distinguish between `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) conditions.

**Example:** For `fun isInRange(x: Int) = x >= 0 && x <= 100`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `&& → \|\|` | `x >= 0 \|\| x <= 100` | `isInRange(-5)` should be false |

And for `fun isOutOfRange(x: Int) = x < 0 || x > 100`:

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `\|\| → &&` | `x < 0 && x > 100` | `isOutOfRange(-5)` should be true |

These mutations catch tests that only exercise the "happy path" where both conditions agree. If `&&` and `||` would produce the same result for all your test inputs, the mutation survives - revealing that your tests don't cover the case where the two conditions disagree.

### How Boolean Inversion Mutations Work

Boolean inversion mutations verify that your tests detect when a boolean value is flipped. Every boolean expression - function calls, property accesses, and variable/parameter reads - is mutated by wrapping it in `!`.

**Function calls and property accesses (`expr()` → `!expr()`):**

```kotlin
fun isActive(user: User): Boolean {
    return user.isEnabled()
}
```

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `isEnabled() → !isEnabled()` | `return !user.isEnabled()` | `isActive(enabledUser)` should be true |

**Boolean variables and parameters (`varName` → `!varName`):**

```kotlin
fun inheritedSelection(invertSelection: Boolean, parentSelected: Boolean): Boolean {
    return if (invertSelection) !parentSelected else parentSelected
}
```

| Mutation | Code becomes | Caught by test |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `invertSelection → !invertSelection` | `if (!invertSelection)` | Test with `invertSelection=true` should invert |
| `parentSelected → !parentSelected` | `!(!parentSelected)` / `!parentSelected` | Test should verify both branches |

**Discarded results are not inverted:** a boolean call whose value is thrown away, such as `list.add(x)` or `flow.tryEmit(value)` on its own line, gets no inversion point. The call and its arguments still run exactly the same, so the mutant would be equivalent and no test could kill it. Only the outermost call of a statement counts as discarded; in `rows.add(x > 0)` the `>` is still mutated.

**Negation removal is implicit:** There is no separate "remove `!`" mutation. Adding `!` to the inner expression of `!expr` produces `!(!expr)`, which evaluates to `expr` - achieving the same effect. This simplification covers all boolean types uniformly without special-casing negation.

These mutations catch tests that don't verify the polarity of boolean results. If your test calls a function but doesn't assert the actual boolean value, the inversion mutation will survive.

### How Boolean Return Mutations Work

Boolean return mutations verify that your tests actually check return values, not just that the code runs without error.

**Example:** For a function with explicit returns:
```kotlin
fun isInRange(x: Int, min: Int, max: Int): Boolean {
    if (x < min) return false
    if (x > max) return false
    return true
}
```

| Mutation | Original | Becomes | Caught when |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `return false → true` | `return false` | `return true` | Test asserts false for out-of-range |
| `return false → false` | `return false` | `return false` | (no change - original behavior) |
| `return true → true` | `return true` | `return true` | (no change - original behavior) |
| `return true → false` | `return true` | `return false` | Test asserts true for in-range |

**Note:** Boolean return mutations only apply to explicit `return` statements in block-bodied functions. Expression-bodied functions (`fun foo() = expr`) are mutated via their expression operators instead.

### How Nullable Return Mutations Work

Nullable return mutations verify that your tests check actual return values, not just non-null.

**Example:** For a function that returns nullable:
```kotlin
fun findUser(id: Int): User? {
    val user = database.query(id)
    if (user != null) {
        return user
    }
    return null
}
```

| Mutation | Original | Becomes | Caught when |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `return user → null` | `return user` | `return null` | Test asserts actual user properties |

**Common weak test patterns this catches:**
```kotlin
// WEAK: Only checks non-null, not the actual value
val user = findUser(1)
assertNotNull(user)  // Would still pass with null mutation? NO - but doesn't verify content

// WEAK: Uses the value but doesn't verify it
val user = findUser(1)
println(user?.name)  // No assertion at all!

// STRONG: Verifies actual content
val user = findUser(1)
assertEquals("Alice", user?.name)  // Catches null mutation
```

**Note:** Nullable return mutations only apply to explicit `return` statements in block-bodied functions that return nullable types. The mutation replaces the return value with `null`.

### How Void Function Body Mutations Work

Void function body mutations verify that your tests check side effects, not just that a function can be called without error.

**Example:** For a Unit function with side effects:
```kotlin
fun addItem(item: String) {
    items.add(item)
    updateCount()
}
```

| Mutation | Original | Becomes | Caught when |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| empty body | full body | `{ }` | Test asserts `items` contains the added item |

**Common weak test patterns this catches:**
```kotlin
// WEAK: Only calls the function, doesn't verify anything
service.addItem("apple")
// No assertion!

// WEAK: Only checks that no exception is thrown
assertDoesNotThrow { service.addItem("apple") }

// STRONG: Verifies the side effect
service.addItem("apple")
assertEquals(listOf("apple"), service.getItems())  // Catches empty body mutation
```

**Note:** Void function body mutations only apply to functions that return Unit, have non-empty bodies, and are not property accessors (getters/setters).

### How Exception Type Swap Mutations Work

Exception type swap mutations verify that your tests assert *which* exception was thrown, not merely that the call failed.

**Example:** For a function that validates its input:
```kotlin
fun withdraw(amount: Int) {
    if (amount <= 0) throw IllegalArgumentException("amount must be positive")
    ...
}
```

| Mutation | Original | Becomes | Caught when |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| type swap | `IllegalArgumentException` | `IllegalStateException` | Test asserts the specific exception type |

**Common weak test patterns this catches:**
```kotlin
// WEAK: Only checks that something went wrong
assertThrows<Exception> { account.withdraw(-5) }

// WEAK: Catches the supertype, so a swapped sibling still matches
assertThrows<RuntimeException> { account.withdraw(-5) }

// STRONG: Asserts the exact type
assertThrows<IllegalArgumentException> { account.withdraw(-5) }  // Catches the type swap
```

Wrap the call as usual and assert around it - the exception escaping the block is fine, mutation points reached before the throw are still discovered:
```kotlin
assertThrows<IllegalArgumentException> {
    MutFlow.underTest { account.withdraw(-5) }
}
```

**Swap pairs:**

| Original | Becomes |
|----------|---------|
| `IllegalArgumentException` | `IllegalStateException` |
| `IllegalStateException` | `IllegalArgumentException` |
| `NullPointerException` | `IllegalArgumentException` |
| `IndexOutOfBoundsException` | `IllegalStateException` |
| `UnsupportedOperationException` | `IllegalStateException` |
| `ClassCastException` | `IllegalArgumentException` |
| `NumberFormatException` | `IllegalStateException` |
| `ArithmeticException` | `IllegalStateException` |
| `NoSuchElementException` | `IllegalStateException` |

Pairs are chosen so that neither type is a subtype of the other. A swap to a subtype would be an equivalent mutant, since a `catch` of the supertype matches both. This is why `NumberFormatException` is paired with `IllegalStateException` rather than with `IllegalArgumentException`, which it extends.

Constructor arguments are copied by position onto a matching constructor of the target type, so `throw IllegalArgumentException(message, cause)` mutates to `IllegalStateException(message, cause)`.

**Note:** Only a `throw` of a direct constructor call is mutated. `val e = IllegalStateException(); throw e` is not, since the thrown expression is a variable read rather than a constructor call. Constructs that eventually become throws (`!!`, `TODO()`, `require`/`check`, exhaustive `when` without `else`) are never mutated by this operator either, because they are still ordinary calls at the point where the compiler plugin runs.

## Design Decisions

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture details, design decisions, and implementation plan.

## Troubleshooting

### Code coverage (JaCoCo/Kover) reports 0% when mutflow is enabled

mutflow compiles your sources twice - once normally (`main`) and once with mutations injected (`mutatedMain`). During tests, the mutated classes are loaded instead of the original ones. Since coverage tools instrument the `main` classes, they see no execution.

**Solution:** Run coverage and mutation testing as separate steps:

```bash
./gradlew test -Pmutflow.enabled=false   # coverage run
./gradlew test                            # mutation testing run
```

See [Disabling Mutation Testing](#disabling-mutation-testing) for all configuration options.
